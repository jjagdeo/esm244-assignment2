```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```

1. A useful descriptive introductory summary (3 - 4 sentences) of whatâ€™s contained in the project

2. Image(s), with captions and necessary citation(s), of Bonneville Dam and/or steelhead (or whatever time series data you choose to explore)

3. All of your organized and well-annotated code (with warnings/messages hidden) used to create at least:

A finalized time series plot of the original observations (daily data)
A finalized seasonplot to explore if/how monthly passage has shifted over time (I totaled counts by month before doing this...you can choose if you want to do that)
A finalized visualization of annual steelhead passage counts 

4. Make sure that your figures appear in your final knitted document, each with a useful caption. Include text associated with each to help the audience understand and interpret the results. 

```{r}

#### 1. Load necessary packages.
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(kableExtra)
library(naniar)
library(skimr)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(paletteer)
library(lubridate)

# For ts stuff: 
library(tsibble)
library(fable)
library(fabletools)
library(feasts)
library(forecast)

```

#### 2. Read in the data: steelhead salmon passage across the Bonneville Dam (Oregon) from 1940 - 2019

```{r}

salmon <- read_csv("cbr_fish_passage_bonneville_allyrs_steelhead.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = paste(year, mm_dd, sep = "-")) %>% 
  mutate(date_new = lubridate::parse_date_time(date, "ydm")) 

# Look for NAs

gg_miss_var(salmon)

# Remove NAs

salmon_clean <- salmon %>% 
  drop_na(value, date_new) %>% 
  select(year, date_new, value)
  
```

```{r}

salmon_plot <- ggplot(salmon_clean, aes(x = date_new, 
                                   y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Salmon Count")
  
salmon_plot

```

```{r}

salmon_ts <- as_tsibble(salmon_clean, key = value, index = date_new)

```
